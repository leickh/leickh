Hello, I'm Lena Ickhorn.

I'm capable of using the following programming languages
(sorted by skill):
- C  
    C is my main language, I prefer using it with
    `-Wall`, `-Wextra` and `-Wpedantic`.
- Bash  
    I use the Bourne Again Shell for build scripts.
    Sometimes I'm forced to use CMake, though.
- Netwide x86-Assembly  
    Some low-level things require Assembly. I'm on the Intel syntax
    side; the AT&T syntax looks weird.
- C++  
    For projects in which it is absolutely required, Bjarne
    Stroustrup's leg amputation machine is also in my repertoire.

I write code in those languages using VSCodium and `nano`.

Technology Interests (sorted by skill):

- Parsers
- Code Size & Speed Optimization
- (3D -) Graphics
- Compilers & Interpreters
- Baremetal Development & OSDev

Spoken Languages:

- German  (C2)
- English (~B1 / C2)
- Spanish (*C3-PO*, A2)
